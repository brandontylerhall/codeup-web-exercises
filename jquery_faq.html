				<dt class="margin">Where can I see Animals?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">Check at visitor centers for information about recent sightings.</dd>

				<dt class="margin">How did Yellowstone get its name?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">Yellowstone National Park is named after the Yellowstone River, the major river running
					through the park. According to French-Canadian trappers in the 1800s, they asked the name of the river from the
					Minnetaree tribe, who live in what is now eastern Montana. They responded “Mi tse a-da-zi,” which literally
					translates as “Rock Yellow River.” The trappers translated this into French as “Roche Jaune” or “Pierre Jaune.”
					In 1797, explorer-geographer David Thompson used the English translation—“Yellow Stone.” Lewis and Clark called
					the Yellowstone River by the French and English forms. Subsequent use formalized the name as “Yellowstone.
				</dd>

				<dt class="margin">Is Yellowstone the largest national park?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">No. More than half of Alaska’s national park units are larger, including Wrangell–St. Elias
					National Park and Preserve, which is the largest unit (13 million acres) in the National Park System. Until
					1994, Yellowstone (at 2.2 million acres) was the largest national park in the contiguous United States. That
					year Death Valley National Monument was expanded and became a national park—it has more than 3 million acres.
				</dd>

				<dt class="margin">Is Yellowstone the most visited national park?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">Yellowstone is in the top five national parks for number of recreational visitors. Great Smoky
					Mountains National Park often has the most visitors.</dd>

				<dt class="margin">What is the difference between a national park and a national forest?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">National parks are administered by the Department of the Interior and national forests by the
					Department of Agriculture. The National Park Service is mandated to preserve resources unimpaired, while the
					Forest Service is mandated to wisely manage resources for many sustainable uses. Six national forests surround
					Yellowstone National Park.
				</dd>

				<dt class="margin">How many rangers work in Yellowstone?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">Approximately 738 people work for the National Park Service during the peak summer season.
					Approximately 386 are permanent, year-round employees. Park rangers work in education, resource management, law
					enforcement, emergency medical services, and backcountry operations. Other employees specialize in research,
					maintenance, management, administration, trail maintenance, fire management, and fee collection.
				</dd>

				<dt class="margin">How do you become a park ranger?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">Many National Park Service employees begin their careers as volunteers or as seasonal
					employees. Hiring is very competitive and is conducted through the Office of Personnel Management.
				</dd>

				<dt class="margin">Can we swim in rivers and lakes?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">Swimming is not recommended because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold. Firehole
					Canyon, near Madison Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer. Soaking in thermal features is illegal.
					Swimming is allowed during daylight hours only and at your own risk.
				</dd>

				<dt class="margin">What is the highest peak in the park?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">Eagle Peak in the southeastern part of Yellowstone is the highest at 11,358 feet.</dd>

				<dt class="margin">Does Yellowstone include a federally designated wilderness?</dt>
				<dd class="invisible">No. Most of the park was recommended for this designation in 1972, but Congress has not acted
					on the recommendation.
