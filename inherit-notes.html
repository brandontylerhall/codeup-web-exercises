<div>
	Here is <span>a span element</span> which is blue, as span elements are set to be.
</div>

<div class="extra" style="color:green">
	 Here is <span>a span element</span> which is green, because it inherits from its parent.
</div>

<!--here, since the div doesn't contain the class extra, the span retains the blue color while the text takes on the red coloring -->
<div style="color:red">
	Here is <span>a span element</span> which is blue, as span elements are set to be.
</div>
